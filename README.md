# Tata Car Data Analysis using SQL

## Project Description
This project analyzes Tata car models using SQL. The dataset includes various car attributes like mileage, price, engine type, transmission, safety ratings, and sales regions. The goal is to derive insights about car trends, pricing, safety, fuel efficiency, and market distribution.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of the following attributes:
- **Car_Model** – Model name
- **Variant** – Specific variant
- **Year_of_Manufacture** – Year of production
- **Engine_Type** – Petrol, Diesel, CNG, Electric
- **Transmission** – Manual or Automatic
- **Mileage_kmpl** – Fuel efficiency
- **Price_INR_Lakhs** – Price in INR lakhs
- **Fuel/Battery_Capacity** – Fuel tank or battery size
- **Seating_Capacity** – Number of seats
- **Safety_Rating** – Safety score (1-5)
- **Sales_Region** – Region where the car was sold

## SQL Queries and Analysis
The analysis includes:
- **Top 5 most expensive cars**
- **Average mileage by engine type**
- **Best-rated electric cars**
- **Total cars sold by region**
- **Cheapest automatic car**
- **Car production trends over the years**
- **Highest fuel/battery capacity models**
- **Top safest cars**
- **Manual vs. automatic distribution**
- **Best mileage cars under 10 lakhs**

## Insights
- Identified the **most expensive and fuel-efficient models**.
- Analyzed **sales trends across different regions**.
- Compared **engine types based on mileage and price**.
- Found the **safest and most affordable cars**.
- Understood **market trends using SQL queries**.
